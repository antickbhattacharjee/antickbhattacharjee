## ❤️ A Little About Me

I believe technology education should be practical and empowering. I enjoy helping learners build confidence, solve real problems, and grow as creators.

When I’m not teaching or coding, I explore new tools, mentor developers, and build training resources that help programmers think deeply and build confidently.
